    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Please note this version is the development branch of the game, so expect a rough ending, weird messages and other things, along with bugs.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>There aren't as much levels as I hoped too, but there's an ending. It's abrupt, but the deadline was tight.</h2>
    <h2>And please note; there are still bugs in it that I'm aware of, otherwise, have fun!</h2>
