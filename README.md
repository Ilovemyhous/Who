# Who ?
A game for a school project coded in JavaScript.
Made by *Ilovemyhouse*.
### Version
0.1.2

## About
This is a game about one person (or two if we count you) were you will be asked questions, resolve puzzles, having an adventure, a bit of horror (which means; jumpscares), and maybe having multiple endings.

The inspiration of this project, was a way to describe/show of, how I sometimes see things... and what I see, when I want to be alone. I was also mainly inspired by the [Professor Layton](https://www.laytonseries.com/) series.

The game is only writen in HTML, CSS and JavaScript... that's it.

## Known issues:
- The credits scroll faster on larger screens (like 4K)
- Story 2 sends you straight to the credits instead of continuing the game.
- Level 4 sends you to a broken Story 3.
- Last question in Story 2 counts as Yes, even though No was said.
- Fix animations at Story 2.
- Probably more

## Install
Download/Clone the code, and launch the *Arrival.html* file.

To use things like the audio setting in the settings, you will need [*vscode-live-server*](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server).

## Compatibility
I've only tested the game on a Firefox based browser on Linux. The experience might differ from the browser, and/or OS.
