# Who ?
A game for a school project coded in JavaScript.
Made by *Ilovemyhouse*.
### Version
0.1.2

## About
This is a game about one person (or two if we count you) were you will be asked questions, resolve puzzles, having an adventure, a bit of horror (which means; jumpscares), and maybe having multiple endings.

The inspiration of this project, was a way to describe/show of, how I sometimes see things... and what I see, when I want to be alone. I was also mainly inspired by the [Professor Layton](https://www.laytonseries.com/) series.

The game is only writen in HTML, CSS and JavaScript... that's it.
