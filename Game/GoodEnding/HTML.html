    <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>You've made it trough this (buggy) messy game!</h2>
    <h2>I know, you have a lot of questions, and are confused, and concerned about the abrupt ending.</h2>
    <h2>First of all, I'm sorry for not delivering the experience you've expected (or maybe I did?).</h2>
    <h2>The deadline was coming faster then expected, and homeworks keept coming, and coming.</h2>
    <h2>But I still wanted to deliver a quick Alpha/Beta playable game, to get an idea of what it'll look like.</h2>
    <h2>Rest assured! I'll try to finish this game, by working on it in my full time.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>In the meantime, be WHO you are, and be proud of it.</h2>
